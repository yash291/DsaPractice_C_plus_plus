how to initialize the whole array with any value using one line
1.) int num[5]={ [0 . . . 4 ] = 3 };  // num = { 3, 3, 3, 3, 3}
2.) We may also ignore the size of array:
int num[  ]={ [0 . . . 4 ] = 3 };    // num = { 3, 3, 3, 3, 3}

Never use variable inplace of size of array.

We must always initialize the array as per the given values in the constraint in the array.

Whenever we pass array to any function in that case the base address of the array is getting 
passed so the changes are done in the actual array.
