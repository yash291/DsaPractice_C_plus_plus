The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's 
in its binary representation.

For example, The integer 5 is "101" in binary and its complement is "010" which is the integer 2.
Given an integer n, return its complement.

How to make a mask:
 Step 1: run your loop in the given number untill the number becomes zero
 Step 2: count how many iterations it ran
 Step 3: initialize a mask with zero
 Step 4: insert one at last of mask by doing left shit by 1 and or operation
