If we want to check that any bit is 0 or 1 then if we do bitwise and with 1
and if the result is 0 then bit will be 0 else 1

To find the right most bit we can do and with the 1 then we can find the right most bit

To make the number with the same flow i.e to make 123 from digit 1,2,3:
    ans = (digit * 10) + ans
To make the reverse:
    ans = (digit * pow(10,i)) + ans

If we are dealing with digits then we need to make % and / use
If we are dealing with bits then we need to make & and >> use.
